This program requires the yaml-cpp library (included), the Xerces-C library, and premake4.
Simply generate files with premake4, then build.
The .lsybin file doesn't need to guarantee exact order (as each question is numbered), so the output will probably be quite mixed up.
libyaml-cpp.a and the entire contents of the yaml-cpp folder do NOT belong to me.
They are from http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp.
